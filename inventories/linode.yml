plugin: linode
# Linode inventory plugin inventory, partial example
# 
# This should be operable with only the access_token provided
# the linode inventory plugin also allows for providing the
# access token via an environment variable, so you might use this like:
# 
# LINODE_ACCESS_TOKEN=foobar ansible-inventory -i plugins/example_linode/linode.yml --list
# 
# The linode inventory plugin was (or will be) introduced in Ansible 2.8
# If you do not have that version of Ansible, it should give an error
#   from the auto plugin that the inventory specifies unknown plugin
# This requires linode_api4 dependency to work, so in your venv run:
#    pip install linode_api4
#   without that, it will error that it requires linode_api4
# If you don't specify the auth token, then it should give an error specific
#   to this scenario, that auth isn't specified
